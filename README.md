# Arxiv Harvest

This Intenetion of this repository is to contain database harverster scripts of multipule open databases that are providers in OAI. Currently we are only focused on Arxiv.org, eventually we'll expand more and include more databses to our platfrom.

## How Script works?

Scripts are written in python, they need 3 arguments from the system. Start Date, End Date and a text("as an indicator for download range")

`python 2018-01-01 2018-12-31 all_data`

## Date format

The date format scripts using are in YYYY-mm-dd.
